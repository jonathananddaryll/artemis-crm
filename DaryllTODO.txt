todo:

1. install uuid to generate id on new item creation.
2. finalize board table (maybe ahve to create a colum table that is connected to board)
3. job API
4. actions folder/skeleton that is gonna be the action that connects reducer to the API
5.

DND feature
1. make sure to have the job order by where the user dropped the job/card (maybe splice array and adding it with index might work)



API/sql
1. make sure the column_num inside column is generated by querying(maybe just in state) the last_column_num from the selected board and adding + 1 to it, that way the newly added column will always be the last column.
